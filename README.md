# FSM
## Task 2:
### Implementation of working of a Dual Elevator System using FSM(Finite State Machine) with dynamic input and initial input 
        
        Approach-Implemented finite state machines for the lift encounter problem using basic knowledge of classes in python
        and tried to use inheritance wherever possible.For Dynamic input I added a function for the flow of time and used 
        socket programming learnt in Task1 for sending and receiving data from The client side to the lift system side 
        
        Running:-
        1.Run the lift python script
        2.Run the client python script in another Terminal
        3.Enter an input for number of initial inputs(>0) in the lift and Enter Y during the 
        execution of code in the client terminal to add dynamic input 
        
        Input Format-INITIAL FLOOR DIRECTION(U/D) TARGET FLOOR
